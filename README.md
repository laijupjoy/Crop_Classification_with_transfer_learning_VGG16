# Crop Classification with Transfer Learning VGG16

Building a Classification model using VGG16 pre-trained model using Tensorflow & Keras.<br>

Image classification refers to a process in computer vision that can classify an image according to its visual content.
This is a image classification based on Agriculture crop images of wheat,rice,sugarcane,jute,maize(Corn).

**About the data:**<br>
Dataset available at kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/aman2000jaiswal/agriculture-crop-images?select=crop_images

## Data Analysis

**Image Categories VS Number of images in each Categories:**<br>

## Data Preprocessing

For every Train and Test images,resize the image to have a shape of (224, 224, 3)=(image_width, image_height, number of channels): because images in the dataset come in different sizes.
So, all images should have the same shape to feed it as an input to the VGG16 neural network.
